Code for an activity proposed by the C# course on the udemy.com website.

Make a program to read the path of a .csv file containing the data of items sold. Each item has a name, unit price and quantity, separated by a comma. You must generate a new file called "summary.csv", located in a subfolder called "out" from the original folder of the source file, containing only the name and total value for that item (unit price multiplied by quantity), as per example:

Source file:
TV LED,1290.99,1
Video Game Chair,350.50,3
Iphone X,900.00,2
Samsung Galaxy 9,850.00,2

Output file(\out\summary.csv):
TV LED,1290.99
Video Game Chair,1051.50
Iphone X,1800.00
Samsung Galaxy 9,1700.00
